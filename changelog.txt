1. Gradient Boosted Machine
  Number of estimators: 100
  Max depth of estimator: 3
  Learning rate: 1.0

  Feature selection:
    Description:
      Use the 25 categorical features found in projects.csv binarized with LabelEncoder
      
    Reasoning:
      Just to test if things work
      Don't need to use one-hot encoding since we're using decision trees

    Future:
      "Different kinds of models have different advantages. The boosted trees model is very good at handling tabular data with numerical features, or categorical features with fewer than hundreds of categories. One important note is that tree based models are not designed to work with very sparse features. When dealing with sparse input data (e.g. categorical features with large dimension), we can either pre-process the sparse features to generate numerical statistics, or switch to a linear model, which is better suited for such scenarios."

      Some of our categories are quite sparse, so we should generate statistics (frequency?) for the categorical features

2. Gradient Boosted Machine (89.028318 %)
  Number of estimators: 100
  Max depth of estimator: 7
  Learning rate: 0.01

  Feature selection:
    Description:
      Use the 25 categorical features found in projects.csv binarized by replacing the categories with their frequencies
      Use some constructed historical features
      Use word counts of essay features
      
    Reasoning:
      See above future changes
