1. Gradient Boosting Model (94.018773076136453 %)
  Number of estimators: 100
  Max depth of estimator: 3
  Learning rate: 1.0

  Feature selection:
    Description:
      Use the 25 categorical features found in projects.csv with LabelEncoder

    Reasoning:
      Just to test if things work

  Training/Validation split:
    Description:
      Training data before 2014
      Did not omit data before April 2010 unlike top submissions
      Select validation set randomly from training data with 70/30 training/validation split

    Reasoning:
      70/30 split seems to be a commonly used ratio
      Random sampling usually the best
      But since we have time data, perhaps we should consider using more recent data for validation
